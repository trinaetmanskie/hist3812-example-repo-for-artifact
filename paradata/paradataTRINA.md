# Module 1
Creating this module was a difficult process. I began this process widely underestimating not only the importance of digital history but also the difficulty involved. After making one model myself (although it really is only half because of how it turned out) I wonder if this is really a time efficient way of reproducing. Before I decided to pick what item I was going to scan for this model, I sat down and brainstormed a list of words/phrases that I wanted to focus on.

- important

- something that makes a difference

- silenced voices

- blending

- Canadian history

- retelling

- re-narrating

- educational

- teaching

- adaptable

- kids

- resource

- Indigenous voices

I originally thought I would use a piece from the new Canadian History Hall to display the three main voices that are often heard in Canadian history (British, French-Canadian and Indigenous people). I thought after some consideration and listening to pointers from other students in the class that I needed somewhere with better lighting. That is when I thought of the War of 1812 Monument. I had recently looked at this statue for a previous class and I was intrigued by the diversity from this statue. Even though this statue shows multiple personalities of Canada I do not hear much about this piece. I think that this statue is widely underrated and that is one of the reasons why I chose it. 



There were several difficult parts to constructing this model. I originally intended to use an app (from the App Store, on iPhone) called Trnio. In class I was able to create a model of my shoe quite easily using this app. However when I went downtown to create the model it was much more difficult. The background was distracting for the application and even after two attempts I was unable to get a good model. I then decided to circle around the monument twice taking pictures every step (about 1 foot apart). I took over 60 photographs of the monument. It was so cold outside though that my cell phone froze and turned off. Therefore I was unable to look at the photographs and see if they worked. I would recommend using a real camera (DSLR) not a cell phone. Second, make sure that you always have a back-up device for capturing pictures. I was lucky enough that the photographs did turn out. I would recommend bringing a “selfie-stick” or any device that allows you have to have a steady handle on the camera or phone for higher up photos or a video. 



The next step was to remove the backgrounds from the photographs. I uploaded the photos to my Macbook. I intended on using Photoshop but did not want to pay a hefty price so I looked for several free services. I started by using “Paint 2”. This is similar to paint from Windows and works extremely well at cutting the backgrounds out (similar feature to Photoshop). One issue though is that without purchasing the complete set then when you create a transparent background, Paint 2 adds a watermark to the background when exporting. I decided to use Gimp after being recommended by another student in the class. Using the eraser tool and patience, after 10 hours of work I had removed all the backgrounds on 34 photographs. If I had more time I would have liked to have used more photographs since I believe that would have made it easier when creating the 3D model on Regard3D. 

The next difficult part was setting up Regard3D and Exiftool. I installed Exiftool over 15 times but simply because I was making a simple mistake. Simply I was unable to locate the pictures in my terminal because I was not changing the direction of (all I needed was to add “cd module*” to my search to make it easier. After about an hour and a half I figured out the issue. I then was able to add metadata and make changes very easily. I uploaded the images to Regard3D and then began “computed matches”. I triangulated 3 different times because I was really unsure about what I was doing. Looking back, after the second time I had the best version. I then started densification. I did this over 8 times. I played with as many different versions of this as I could but it was difficult to understand because I really was unsure of what I was doing. I tried to use this tutorial: http://www.regard3d.org/index.php/documentation/tutorial but I was still struggling. 



I found surface generation and tried this 7 times. I struggled to find a way in which I could export the best version that I created. In order to export your model surface you must create it with coloured vertices and not texture. The best version of the model was using texture as the surface generator but it was unable to be exported. I tried many times to change the texture back using SketchFab once it was uploaded but I was unable to. 



Finally I uploaded my versions into Sketchfab. I played with the background colour, dimming and lighting to display the model to the best of my ability. This model is not at all what I intended for it to look like. I intend to keep working and practicing with Regard3D in hopes to fix my model. One mistake that could have been prevented from the model would have been to pick a smaller item to scan. It would have been easier to work with especially because it was my first time creating a digital 3D model. Secondly, I should not have waited so long to begin this assignment. If I would have had more time I could have researched more information and practiced using Regard3D and Sketchfab. I feel as though my lack of knowledge hindered my abilities incredibly. SketchFab has so many incredible features such as adding backgrounds to models. I could have added a background with this model of a photograph of the war of 1812. This would have added to the creativity and the reproduction/retelling of the story of this monument. 



I picked this monument because of how underrated I feel that it is. This monument reflects the society that participated in the war of 1812 and very often women and Indigenous people are left out of the narrative of Canadian History. As time continues we continue to rewrite and retell these stories of the past and this monument does that. I believe that this statue is a step in the right direction and should receive more publication. It is a free monument and it is outside. There are no limitations for people to visit except if they are unable to come to Ottawa. I think replicating and reproducing this piece for people to know is widely important. Reproducing can showcase this statue to a wider audience. The monument of the War of 1812 is about diversity and right now, Canada indulges on the important of diversity. 



Walter Benjamin, in his journal, “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” discusses the concept of time and space within reproductions. Benjamin says, “Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be (Benjamin 3).  When I first read this quote I agreed with it. I thought that replications were perhaps less appealing and emotional.N No replication could replace the original. But this monument made me think differently. I didn’t study this monument in school and I didn’t visit it on field trips. So then I asked myself, “What if the original perhaps doesn’t hold emotional value but is still important then what does the replication do?” I think this monument is important and tells an important story but it is not as popular as the Mona Lisa so I think reproducing this would benefit it. Even though it is not within the time and space of itself then I believe a replication would be beneficial. 



Another consideration about Benjamin’s point is that this monument is already a replication and reproduction. This is not an item from the war itself. This is something that was done to commemorate and recreate a moment in time. Therefore it was never in the original time and space so the reproductions do not lose value because they were not there. 



I plan to use this monument to narrate and tell the story of those individuals who were and have been silenced in history. I know that I cannot speak for everyone but I hope to start something with this model. It is the beginning but an important one.
