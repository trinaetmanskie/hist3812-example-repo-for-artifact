The War of 1812 monument was erected on Parliament hill November 7th, 2014. 
It was unveiled on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Malcom’s Mills. 
Malcom Mills was the final battle, on Canadian soil, that took place during the war of 1812 *(Ottawa Citizen, para 2)*. 
This statue is unique because it displays the diversity of Canada. 
This monument has “a woman, a First Nations solider, a solider from the British army, a Métis, a Royal Navy sailor and a 
Canadian militiaman” *(Government of Canada, para 2)*. The title given to this piece is **“Triumph through Diversity”** 
*(Government of Canada, para 1)*. 

I chose to model this statue because I felt as though throughout Canadian history there are many voices that remain unheard. 
This monument is one of the few that rejoices and celebrates the unheard and untold voices and stories within Canadian history. 
Located on Parliament Hill, facing the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, this statue displays nationalism, diversity and courage. 
I plan to use this piece to display the voices that so often are left out from the narrative of Canada’s nationalism.
